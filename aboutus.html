				<h1 style="color:#6fbc16;">Rhyme and Reason</h1>
					<p>Rhyme and Reason is a Calgary-based Early Literacy and  Numeracy Program for parents and caregivers of infants. It came about in 2012  in response to the extremely high demand for similar programs from Calgary's  growing population. With programs located all over the city, in high-needs  communities and communities with baby booms, as well as with separate programs for Newborns and Toddlers, we are sure you'll find the perfect program for you and your baby.</p>

				<h1 style="color:#92278f;">Mission Statement and Values</h1>
					<p>Rhyme and Reason aims to strengthen the connections between  infants and their parents and caregivers by using specialized literacy and numeracy  tools to foster interpersonal bonding. These tools will, in turn, give  children the foundations for reading, writing and math that they will require  when they reach school. At Rhyme and Reason, we teach the language, social, and mathematical concepts you need to jumpstart your child's development at an early age, all while having fun in an energetic and supportive environment!</p>

				<h1 style="color:#0054A5;">Why Early Literacy?</h1>
					<p>It is hard to understand the value of literacy without first understanding what we're talking about. 'Literacy' describes all of the skills that allow us to communicate with others, such as mathematical knowledge, computing, and tech savvy. But more that any of this, it means our ability to speak, write and read. Pre-literacy, or Early Literacy, is what our children know about these activites before they can actually perform them.</p>

					<p>Our childrens' language and literacy skills are the single greatest tool we can provide them to help them succeed in later life. High literacy skills are the most important predictor of future success in school, social development, and their overall intelligence. The more words they hear every day, the further our children will go!</p>

				<h1 style="color:#ff0c7a;">Who We Are</h1>

<h2 style="color:#DD2626;">Miss Alex</h2>
					<p>Rhyme and Reason is a program developed by Alexandra May, a children's programmer who has worked for years in the fields of Childcare and Education within such well-known organizations as Gymboree Play and Learn, The YMCA, The City of Calgary, and the Calgary Public Library. She received her degree in English Language and Literature from the University of Calgary and studied abroad at Lancaster University in England. Her educational background and programming experience have culminated in the creation of a new Pre-Literacy program that directly meets the needs and wants of Calgary's Parents. Alex is happiest working with children, who make much more sense to her than grown-ups. </p>

<h2 style="color:#DD2626;">Miss Jocelyn</h2>
					<p>Jocelyn Gross&eacute; (B.A., B.Ed) cultivates a passion for teaching, literacy, and the arts. She facilitates both children's programs and early literacy programs at the Calgary Public Library. As an educator, she has taught visual art and drama to everyone from the very young to the respectably old (including at the Village Square Leisure Centre, the Wildflower Arts Centre, and the South Fish Creek Recreation Association.) Her teaching practicum at Calgary's Capitol Hill school - a Reggio-based arts program - serves as another profound influence. Jocelyn studied visual art at Alberta College of Art and Design, dance in Cuba, and has played drums in three very different Calgary bands. With her young son, she participated in Calgary's Roots of Empathy Program. She additionally volunteers as both an educational ambassador and a wildlife rehabilitator.</p>

<h2 style="color:#DD2626;">Miss Valerie</h2>
					<p>Valerie Viccars is a Children's Librarian and certiÔ¨Åed Parent-Child Mother Goose Teacher. She obtained her Masters in Library and Information Studies in 2005, and has been delivering children's programming for almost a decade. Prior to branching out on her own, Valerie was the Manager of Early Literacy and Children's Services at the Calgary Public Library. She began the 'At Home with Mother Goose' program as a way to provide more flexibility in early literacy programming for busy parents and caregivers in Calgary.</p>
